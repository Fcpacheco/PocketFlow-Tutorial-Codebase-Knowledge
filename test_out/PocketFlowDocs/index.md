# Tutorial: PocketFlowDocs

PocketFlow is a *Python framework* designed to build modular AI workflows by connecting individual **Nodes**—atomic task units—within orchestrating **Flows**.  
These **Flows** guide the execution order based on **Actions** returned by the Nodes, while data is continuously passed and shared through a central **shared dictionary**.  
PocketFlow supports advanced needs like **asynchronous processing** for efficient I/O operations, **batch processing** to handle multiple items or repeated workflows, and an **A2A Communication Framework** enabling agents to communicate with other systems via a standardized JSON-RPC protocol.  
This modular design allows developers to create flexible, scalable, and interoperable AI applications easily.
